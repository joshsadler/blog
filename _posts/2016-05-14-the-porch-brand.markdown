*My previous post was about my mom's coffee shop but mostly about some dots connecting for me on the importance of design in the creation of a business and a product.*

I've been working on a logo for my mom's coffee shop as a gift. It's been a fun process and I wanted to share the evolution of ideas that lead to the *maybe* final logo.

![final]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/the-porch-logo.png)

What we ended up with for mugs:

<div class="row" style="margin-bottom:32px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 800px;">
    <figure class="photo-50">
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/the-porch-mug.png" style="margin: auto;">
    </figure>
    <figure class="photo-50">
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/the-porch-chariton-map.png" style="margin: auto;">
    </figure>
</div>

![real life]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/the-porch-real-life.png)



A couple of older iterations:

<div class="row" style="margin-bottom:32px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 800px;">
    <figure class="photo-50">
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/the-porch-tall.png" style="margin: auto;">
    </figure>
    <figure class="photo-50">
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/the-porch-w-desc.png" style="margin: auto;">
    </figure>
</div>


My mom is really excited about the logo and the brand. We have mood boards around the aesthetic for the shop that I can't wait to share as well. And hopefully I can convince her to let me put up a website for the business, too. ;)
