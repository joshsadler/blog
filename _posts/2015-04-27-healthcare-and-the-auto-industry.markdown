They have nothing in comomon (right?) but if I didn’t work in the financial technology industry, I’d pick healthcare or automotive. 

I’ve gone to the doctor a dozen times already in 2015 (I’m fine) and each time I’m disgusted by the software used by nurses and doctors to figure out my history. Shouldn’t they just carry around an iPad with a beautiful interface that contains my medical history and the purpose of my scheduled visit? It’s 2015 y’all. What’s holding us back?

I also bought a new car this year. And while the sales process was a good bit of fun I left thinking it could be better. I bought a 2015 Jeep Renegade. I researched them for a few months, built countless variations on the marketing website and finally found one through a friend that I wanted to buy. The process of building my own car and actually buying it could not have been farther apart. Why can’t I pick out my prefered options and place an order on Jeep.com? Why is the car buying process as bad as it was 15, 20, 30 years ago (I’m guessing)?

In addition to the sale process, software in cars makes my heart hurt. Tesla creates the most modern and delightful driving experience and yet even their software makes me cringe. It’s nowhere near the same level as FCA’s uConnect or Microsoft’s SYNC, but it’s not really comparable to what you see in a modern web app or native mobile app. So why is it so bad? 

Lots of unanswered questions.
